// Hash Tables
// Similar to object in JS, as in they are built of key:value pairs
// Average Big O time of O(1) for search, insert, delete
// Worst case Big O time of O(n) for search, insert, delete (if lots of collisions)
//
// Objects (and Maps) in JS are hash tables/maps that unfortunately overwrite data in collisions. You also don't know the size of the Object
// Need to build own Hash table/map class with search, insert, and delete methods
