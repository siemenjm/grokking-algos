// Linked List
// Type of data structure that contains data and points to the next node in the list
// Can easily add or remove node from the list without reorganizing the entire list, unlike arrays
// Search operations are slow (no random access, have to start search from first node)
// Uses more memory than array because of pointer storage
// Singly linked (points to next), Doubly linked (points to previous and next), Circular linked (last node points to first node)
