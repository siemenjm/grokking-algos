// Graph
// Made up of nodes/vertices and edges
// Edges can be uni-directional or bi-directional (directed graph/undirected graph)
//
// Breadth-First-Search can answer:
// * is there a path from node A to node B
// * what is the shortest path from node A to node B
//
// Graph class consists of two data members: total number of nodes in the graph, and an array of linked lists to store adjacent nodes
